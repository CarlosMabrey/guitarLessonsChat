3. **Song Analysis**: AI analyzes and breaks down the song into learnable components
4. **Practice Session**: User engages with interactive lessons and video playalongs
5. **Progress Tracking**: System tracks user improvements and provides feedback

## Core Features

### 1. Song Management
- Song library with searchable database
- Progress tracking for each song (Not Started, Learning, Comfortable)
- Difficulty ratings and estimated time to learn
- Custom tags for organization (genre, technique focus, etc.)

### 2. AI-Generated Song Breakdown
- **Key Detection**
  - Automatic identification of song key
  - Suggestions for alternative keys based on user skill level
  
- **Scale Visualizations**
  - Fretboard diagrams highlighting relevant scales/modes
  - Interactive scale explorer with audio playback

  - Custom prompt engineering for music analysis
  - GPT model for generating practice recommendations
  - Fine-tuned model for music theory explanations

### Database
- **Local Storage**: SQLite for offline functionality
- **Schema Design**:
  - User profiles with skill progression
  - Song library with metadata
  - Practice history and analytics

### Video Playback
- **Media Engine**: HTML5 video with custom controls
