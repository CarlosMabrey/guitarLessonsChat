### User Journey

1. **Onboarding**: User creates an account and inputs their guitar skill level
2. **Song Addition**: User adds songs they want to learn to their personal library
3. **Song Analysis**: AI analyzes and breaks down the song into learnable components
4. **Practice Session**: User engages with interactive lessons and video playalongs
5. **Progress Tracking**: System tracks user improvements and provides feedback

### Core MVP Features

#### 1. Song Management
- Song library with searchable database
- Progress tracking for each song (Not Started, Learning, Comfortable)
- Difficulty ratings and estimated time to learn
- Custom tags for organization (genre, technique focus, etc.)

#### 2. AI-Generated Song Breakdown
- **Key Detection**: Automatic identification of song key and alternative suggestions
- **Scale Visualizations**: Fretboard diagrams highlighting relevant scales/modes
- **Tempo Analysis**: BPM detection, practice recommendations, metronome integration
- **Chord Diagrams**: Visual representation of all chords with alternative voicings

#### 3. Video Playback
- **Tab Playalong Integration**: Synchronized tablature with video playback
- **Enhanced Playback Controls**: Variable speed, section looping, A/B looping

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Weeks 1-4)
- User account management
- Basic song library
- Simple song analysis (key, chords)
- Standard video playback

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Weeks 5-8)
- Advanced song breakdown
- Interactive scale visualizations
- Custom playback controls
- Progress tracking

### Phase 3: AI Refinement (Weeks 9-12)

✅ Component structure (Sidebar, Header, Cards)  
✅ Multiple pages (Dashboard, Songs library, Song details, Practice, Progress)  
✅ Database module using localStorage for songs, practice sessions, and progress  
✅ Fixed dashboard terminology to match guitar learning context  
✅ Fixed dynamic Tailwind classes in StatsCard  
✅ Practice page with session tracking, timer, and section selection  
✅ Progress tracking page with statistics and achievements  
✅ AI song analysis service implementation (with OpenAI integration)  
✅ Web search capabilities via SERP API  
✅ Mock data fallbacks for development  
✅ Tab viewer via Songsterr integration  
✅ Fixed Songsterr tab viewer to show the correct tab for each song  
✅ Learning resources with embedded playable YouTube videos for each song
