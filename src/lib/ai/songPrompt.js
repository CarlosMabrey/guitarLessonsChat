IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Search for accurate information about this specific song
- Include 3-6 main chords, prioritizing accurate fingerings
- For chord positions, use 6 elements (one per string) where "x" means don't play
- Provide 3 different YouTube links if possible
- Only include Songsterr link if you're confident it exists
- Be precise about difficulty rating based on chord complexity, tempo, and techniques required
- Make technical notes specific to challenging parts of the song

If certain information is unavailable, use your best judgment to provide helpful alternatives.
