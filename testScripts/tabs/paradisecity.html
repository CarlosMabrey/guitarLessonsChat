PARADISE CITY - Guns N' Roses
Tabbed by: Vinny
 
Now you'll have to find out by yourself what rhythm do you want to play, for example in
the intro bit you can only strum the chords once...but if you are playing by yourself
like on an acoustic then it may not sound all that impressive...so what I do is play
the chords,
 G C in (D D UDUDUDUD DD) each and then
 F (D D) C (D D) G (D D UDUD)
adding lil' dead notes before switching to the next chord, and I swear the rythm
changes every time I play.
So figure out the pattern you'll enjoy strumming for this song!
 
Rhythm A :-
Rhythm for the parts before the verses and in the verses...
G5 -(DDUD) -Strike Damp Notes- F5 -(UDU) C5 -(D) Bb5 -(D) x3
C5- (DUDUDDUD)
C5-Bb5-G-F
 
Intro: Play G (Open) slide your strumming finger/pick from the low E string to the
higher e..going through one string at a time
then play G (Barre) C  F  C  G  x2
 
Play the chorus part with the into rhythm
